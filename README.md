## PROJECT: ANALYZE INTERNATIONAL DEBT STATISTICS
> _It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries._
> 
> _In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:_
> - _What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?_
> * _Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?_
> + _What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?_
> 
> _The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015._
